# Note that you can use variable from the System properties
# table. (HOME is currently not there by default.)
# These are expanded when the evaluator manager is created.

# This is a comma-separated list of directories and archive files
# in which the findFile() method of the evaluator will look
# for unqualified files.

# Regular and continuation prompt.
# Note here that we provide an expression for the prompt.
# It can be a literal, or full expression.
# In this example, we have a closure that gives local scope
# for the count variable.
prompt= function() { static int count = 1; return("[" + count++  + "] ");}


# Here is an example of a version that resets itself to another prompt.
#prompt= promptExpression("'>'"); ".. ";

# And here is a self-replacing version with a function.
#prompt= promptExpression('function(){static int n = 0; "[" + ++n + "] ";}') ; "[init] ";

# Here is a less imaginative one that uses the global scope.
#prompt=    _lineNumber++; "["+ _lineNumber + "] ";


# A simple literal will work also, but issue a warning at the beginning of
# the session.

# For the GUI version of omega, the prompt can be

# be displayed.

# The name of a class (as found by Evaluator.findClass)
# which is used to create new default databases in the evaluator.
# This can be the name of any Database class, including the simple
# ObjectDatabase, TypedDatabase, PersistenObjectDatabase.
# Basically this is any class that implements the Database
# interface.
# Currently, bad things happen if the full package name is not provided.
# It is a simple recursive ordering problem that causes an infinite loop.
#defaultDatabaseClass=  org.omegahat.Environment.Databases.ObjectDatabase
#defaultDatabaseClass=  org.omegahat.Environment.Databases.TypedDatabase

# It is not a good idea to use a persistent database
# as the initial default one since the directory Scratch
# may not exist. Instead, it is better to use the 
# language to create new database and have them attached.
#defaultDatabaseClass=  org.omegahat.Environment.Databases.PersistentObjectDatabase


# Uncomment either of these to experiment with signals that are handled
# by the evaluator.
evaluatorClassName= org.omegahat.Environment.Interpreter.InteractiveEvaluator

#evaluatorClassName=org.omegahat.Environment.Interpreter.SignallableEvaluator

# Provides JHelp based help system framework - few files!
#evaluatorClassName=  org.omegahat.Environment.Interpreter.GUIHelpEvaluator


# This version allows dynamic CORBA calls to be made directly
# as if they were local. (Non-dynamic versions that use the stubs
# are always local in appearance).
#evaluatorClassName=  org.omegahat.Interfaces.CORBA.Parser.CorbaAugmentedEvaluator
#evaluatorClassName=  org.omegahat.Interfaces.CORBA.Parser.OrbacusEvaluator

# Shows the sub-expressions as they are evaluated in a JTree.
#evaluatorClassName=  org.omegahat.Environment.Interpreter.TracingEvaluator

# Handles signals using JNI cod. The second allows user level functions 
# to be registered for different signal types.
#evaluatorClassName= org.omegahat.Environment.Interpreter.SignallableEvaluator
#evaluatorClassName= org.omegahat.Environment.System.UserLevelSignalHandler


# The class of the default lexer. This one handles
# nested strings of the form '"abc"' rather than
# treating '' as a character identifier. That behaviour
# is provided in the class omegaJavaLexer
#defaultLexerClass= omegaNestedStringLexer

# Controls how the output of container object is displayed
